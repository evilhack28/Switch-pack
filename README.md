This patch Will be updated along with atmosphere/hekate/all the other stuff inside of it

This only works for V1 NOT patched/MOD CHIP switch for check availability, please enter your switch serial code. Switch lite/oled are already patch the only way to jailbreak it is use a mod chip. This can be among lawn's in our country.

Android/linux can ONLY be installed on Erista custom OS CAN'T be run on Mariko

(if your switch is not patched that mean is a Erista if your switch is possible patched BUT the jailbreak does not work when injecting that not mean your switch is Mariko ONLY V2 are mariko)
